# web-tabletop

A web application made to help recreate tabletop games, like Settlers of Catan,
by creating a virtual tabletop with Phaser. Users share the same board and can
see each other's actions live. Tokens representing game pieces can be spawned
and controlled by users.

## Install

Set up a static web server for the `www` folder.

## Usage
